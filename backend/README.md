# NOT default, but can skip over since main README.md includes everything.

## Description

The backend has been built using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest).
Nest.js is essentially Node.js + express on steroids, making everything a lot easier.
We are still using express as our RESTAPI generator, just with a fancier wrapper.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development 
$ npm run start
